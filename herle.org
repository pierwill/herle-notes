His letters are studded with complex syntactical forms, such as
protestations of humility and submission, which illustrate the keen
awareness demonstrated by early modern letter-writers to maintain and
preserve the strict hierarchical structures inherent in Elizabethan
society (http://www.livesandletters.ac.uk/herle/introduction5.html)
